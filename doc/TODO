ROADMAP
=======

* release 0.5.0
	* AMD64 (SSE2)
		* arithmetics
		* branches
		* conversions
		* ureg/lreg/sreg
		* argument reading
		* load/store
		* argument passing
	* amd64 -> should not use macros starting with x86_
	* test-cases involving large numbers of arguments
	* prepare -> without argument

+ release 0.5.1
	* BUG: stack corruption
	+ SPARC
		* arithmetics
		* branches
		* ureg/lreg/sreg

		* argument passing

+ release 0.5.2
	* BUG: CALLR -- registers used to pass arguments can overwrite register to which used to set target
	* BUG: it is impossible to generete two or more functions with one instance of the compiler (see jit_prolog)
	* arguments passed by registers should not be assigned to other registers if read by GETARG and there is no other GETARG which reads this argument
	+ SPARC: vararg stack corruption
	+ SPARC: get_arg should optimize moves of aligned doubles
